        * Makefile
    
    ./soln folder:
        * README
        * Makefile

Running Instructions :
    Change the command prompt directory to 'GPS-Plotter', which contains the folders'soln' and'server' (both of which contain the files listed above), as well as the validate Makefile. 

    Run the command'make run' in the./soln directory to compile and link the files for the server in the./server directory. Because gnome-terminal is not available, open another terminal (Windows or MacOS) and cd all the way into the./soln folder, then type the command 'python3 client/client.py'. This will activate the plotter.

    How to use the Navigation System:
        - To move up/down/left/right, use W/S/A/D.
        - To remove all routes and selected points from the map, press R.
        - Press Q and E to zoom in and out of the map while keeping the mouse cursor in its previous position.
        - To select the current point as the start or end point of a trip, use the left mouse button.
        - Drag the left mouse button to move around the map.

    In the terminal where the command 'python3 client/client.py' was entered, the coordinate will be displayed.
    
Notes and Assumptions :

    It is assumed that the client sends the route request in two lines without including the 'R' character.

    The assumption that the server does not send the number of waypoints and does not expect an acknowledgement after sending each waypoint's coordinates.

    The assumption that after writing all of the waypoints for a route request to outpipe, the server only sends the 'E' character.

    The assumption is that when the plotter window is closed, the client will write a single 'Q' character to the pipe, which, if read, will clean up and exit the server.
